# **17: KDoc Dokka**

As part of the **assessment requirements**, you will need to document your application where **appropriate**. In **Kotlin**, you document you code using **KDoc** which is the equivalent to **JavaDocs**. 

## KDoc Syntax

A **KDoc** comment starts with `/**` and ends with `*/`. Between `/**` and `*/`, add the appropriate documentation as outlined in the **resource** below.

**Resource:** https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-doc.html#kdoc-syntax

## Generating the Documentation

**Dokka** is **Kotlin's** generation tool. You can read more about **Dokka** in the **resource** below.

**Resource:** https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka

**Note:** please read the **resource** above carefully. Your project is using the **Gradle** plugin, not the **Maven** plugin.
